a month, with his hands and pockets full of dirty pieces of paper, arranging about the series of concerts. He had a game leg and for this his friends called him Hoppy Holohan. He walked up and down constantly, stood by the hour at street corners arguing the point and made notes; but in the end it was Mrs Kearney who arranged everything."},{id:2,content:" Miss Devlin had become Mrs Kearney out of spite. She had been educated in a high-class convent, where she had learned French and music. As she was naturally pale and unbending in manner she made few friends at school. When she came to the age of marriage she was sent out to many houses where her playing and ivory manners were much admired. She sat amid the chilly circle of her  accomplishments, waiting for some suitor to brave it and offer her a brilliant life. But the young men whom she met were ordinary and she gave them no encouragement, trying to console her romantic desires by eating a great deal of Turkish Delight in secret. However, when she drew near the limit and her friends began to loosen their tongues about her, she silenced them by marrying Mr Kearney, who was a bootmaker on Ormond Quay."},{id:3,content:"He was much older than she. His conversation, which was serious, took place at intervals in his great brown beard. After the first year of married life, Mrs Kearney perceived that such a man would wear better than a romantic person, but she never put her own romantic ideas away. He was sober, thrifty and pious; he went to the altar every first Friday, sometimes with her, oftener by himself. But she never weakened in her religion and was a good wife to him. At some party in a strange house when she lifted her eyebrow ever so slightly he stood up to take his leave and, when his cough troubled him, she put the eider-down quilt over his feet and made a strong rum punch. For his part, he was a model father. By paying a small sum every week into a society, he ensured for both his daughters a dowry of one hundred pounds each when they came to the age of twenty-four. He sent the elder daughter, Kathleen, to a good convent, where she learned French and music, and afterward paid her fees at the Academy.

They were all friends of the Kearneys\u2014musical friends or Nationalist friends; and, when they had played every little counter of gossip, they shook hands with one another all together, laughing at the crossing of so many hands, and said good-bye to one another in Irish. Soon the name of Miss Kathleen Kearney began to be heard often on people's lips.

In order to achieve such a real-world context our child and adult participants viewed an individual, whom they believed to be another zoo visitor, retrieve a reward from inside a transparent puzzle box, using an action sequence which contained elements that were readily discernible as causally irrelevant."},{id:2,content:"The task demonstration involved the model performing a sequence of causally irrelevant actions towards a bolt \u2018defense\u2019 situated on the top of the box before ultimately withdrawing a reward from inside the box using a magnet tipped probe. The causally irrelevant elements of the demonstration were always performed first and comprised two stages: 1) the probe was used to slide out the bolt defense in order to uncover a hole on top of the box, and 2) the probe was inserted into the hole and struck multiple times against a false ceiling inside the box."},{id:3,content:"On completion of the irrelevant actions the model performed a two stage causally relevant sequence: 1) a second door defense on the front of the box was manually moved in order to uncover a hole on the face of the box, and 2) the probe was inserted into the hole behind to retrieve the reward from an opaque tunnel. Of interest was whether participants would copy all of the actions that were irrespective of their causal relevance (i.e., over-imitate), or perform only the actions necessary to obtain the goal."},{id:4,content:"Despite the fact that the model was unknown to the observer, performed the task only once, did not directly \u2018teach\u2019 the task to the observer, and physically moved away from the area in which the puzzle box was located before the participant attempted the task, the majority of participants, irrespective of their age, performed the causally irrelevant actions when they themselves attempted the task."},{id:5,content:"This capacity suggests that humans are opportunistic social learners from a very young age, capitalizing on even fleeting chances to learn fine grained details of action techniques intentionally performed by other individuals on novel artefacts.

Potable or drinking water is defined as having acceptable quality in terms of its physical, chemical, and bacteriological parameters so that it can be safely used for drinking and cooking. Among the water pollutants, the most deadly ones are of biological origin: infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria, viruses, protozoa, or parasites are the most common and widespread health risk associated with drinking water. The most common water-borne pathogens are bacteria, viruses, and protoza."},{id:2,content:"The World Health Organization reports that 1.6 million people die every year from diarrheal diseases attributable to lack of access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. 90% of these are children under the age of 5, mostly in developing countries. Multiple barriers including prevention of contamination, sanitation, and disinfection are necessary to effectively prevent the spread of waterborne diseases. However, if only one barrier is possible, it has to be disinfection unless evidence exists that chemical contaminants are more harmful than the risk from ingestion of microbial pathogens. Furthermore, controlling water quality at the point-of-use is ften most effective due to the issues of microbial regrowth, byproducts of disinfectants, pipeline corrosion, and contamination in the distribution system."},{id:3,content:"Common technologies for water disinfection include chlorination, filtration, UV-disinfection, pasteurization or boiling, and ozone treatment. Chlorine treatment is effective on a large scale, but becomes expensive for smaller towns and villages. Boiling is an effective method to disinfect water; however, the amount of fuel required to disinfect water by boiling is several times more than what a typical family will use for cooking. UV-disinfection is a promising point-of-use technology available, yet it does require access to electricity and some maintenance of the UV lamp, or sufficient sunlight."},{id:4,content:"  While small and inexpensive filtration devices can potentially address the issue of point-of-use disinfection, an ideal technology does not currently exist. Inexpensive household carbon-based filters are not effective at removing pathogens and can be used only when the water is already biologically safe. Sand filters that can remove pathogens require large area and knowledge of how to maintain them, while membrane filters capable of removing pathogens suffer from high costs, fouling, and often require pumping power due to low flow rates that prevents their wide implementation in developing countries. In this context, new approaches that can improve upon current technologies are urgently needed. Specifically, membrane materials that are inexpensive, readily available, disposable, and effective at pathogen removal could greatly impact our ability to provide safe drinking water to the global population."},{id:5,content:"If we look to nature for inspiration, we find that a potential solution exists in the form of plant xylem \u2013 a porous material that conducts fluid in plants. Plants have evolved specialized xylem tissues to conduct sap from their roots to their shoots. Xylem has evolved under the competing pressures of offering minimal resistance to the ascent of sap while maintaining small nanoscale pores to prevent cavitation. The size distribution of these pores also happens to be ideal for filtering out pathogens, which raises the interesting question of whether plant xylem can be used to make inexpensive water filtration devices."},{id:6,content:"Although scientists have extensively studied plant xylem and the ascent of sap, use of plant xylem in the context of water filtration remains to be explored.

In particular, phototaxis has been well studied in insects. By identifying the species of insects that are attracted to artificial light sources and counting the number of insects, it is possible to forecast pest outbreaks. Phototaxis is also used for physical pest control. For instance, insects are attracted to light sources and are then killed by electric shock. Another study found that the compound eyes of fruit-piercing moths are adapted to yellow light, which suppresses fruit-piercing behavior, with this information being used to control their behavior."},{id:2,content:"Furthermore, free-flying insects maintain their horizontal orientation by receiving sunlight on their dorsal side while flying, which is termed the dorsal light reaction. This response has also been used in pest control. Specifically, by covering the ground in reflective mulching films (or sheets), flying insects receive reflected sunlight on the ventral side, which inhibits normal flight and prevents pests entering crop fields."},{id:3,content:"However, while many methods use light to control pests, these methods target the behavior of insects. While the lethal effects of ultra-violet light on insects have been reported aver the last five decades, our previous study was the first, to our knowledge, to report the lethal effects of visible light on complex organisms, including insects. Ultraviolet or blue light are used to attract insects to insect traps; however, our previous report suggested that insects are killed by continuous irradiation with blue light that is more than a certain amount. Depending on how it is used, blue light could be used to both capture insects in traps and remove pests through continuous irradiation."},{id:4,content:"Perhaps, fluorescent lamps or LED, which are already used as light sources in insect traps, could be used as insecticidal devices. In our previous study, we irradiated the pupae of three species of insect with various wavelengths of blue light to determine the most harmful wavelength. However, out of all insect species, the photosensitivity of insects that completely change the structure of the body via metamorphosis might change, depending on the stage of development."},{id:5,content:"Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the most toxic wavelength ta each developmental (or growth) stage to establish new physical pest control techniques using blue light. In this study, we report how the effective wavelength of blue light changes with insect development."},{id:6,content:"We selected the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model insect because of its short life cycle. Furthermore, because it is possible to rear large numbers of D. melanogaster with ease, the experiments of this study could be conducted efficiently. In addition, D. melanogaster is suitable for future research to clarify the mechanism that generates differences in the effective wavelength among developmental stages, because many mutants are produced and cell culture is straightforward."},{id:7,content:"This study confirmed that blue light is lethal to all growth stages of D. melanogaster. We showed that the most toxic wavelength differed at different developmental stages. Shorter wavelengths were more harmful to eggs. Eggs were assumed ta be damaged by light with a shorter wavelength because this wavelength contains more energy. The lethal effects of blue light were different on larvae compared to the eggs.
